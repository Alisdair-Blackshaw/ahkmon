- ahkmon wouldn't be possible without [Aeana's DQ10Dialog app](https://www.woodus.com/forums/topic/34653-dq10-dialog-monitor/?tab=comments#comment-538328). Thanks for the inspiration (but screw you for ignoring me on Twitter!)
- Thanks to the lovely community over at the unofficial [Dragon Quest X Discord](https://discord.gg/UFaUHBxKMY) for the support!
